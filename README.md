JRFBrowserController
====================

An super-minimal browser component for iOS7 that puts content first.

The idea here is to have a UIViewController subclass that manages a stack of UIWebViews, so that one can edge-drag them to go forward and back (like in safari). There's also going to be pull-to-refresh. The overall plan is to make a way to display web content in your app while showing as little UI chrome as possible.

It's definitely a WIP. Stay tuned.
